# A basic Remix setup for your exam project

This is a basic web app setup that integrates bootstrap

## Getting started

1. Duplicate `.env.example` to a new file called `.env` and add your MongoDB connection string as the `MONGODB_URL` variable
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
